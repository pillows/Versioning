Versioning
==========

Documentation:

First you should put versioning.php in your root folder or the folder that you would like to make versions for. 
Then if you are using a web browser to complete this task, then visit this link but replace most of the info:
```
http://localhost/folder/versioning.php?version=1.0.0.0&branch=alpha&stable=1&product=onx
```
If you are this through the command line:
```
php versioning.php?version=1.0.0.0&branch=alpha&stable=1&product=onx
```
You can check your zip files in the build folder.
